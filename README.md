# Hangman

## Overview

This webpage simulates the game of "Hangman" by letting the user guess words letter by letter. All the words are related to travel and vacation.

The user guesses letters by pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard. Correct guesses appear in the blanks on the screen and incorrect guess subtract from the number of guesses the user has left. The user had 8 wrong guesses before a the game ends in a loss. The game will tally wins and losses until the page is re-loaded.

## Other Information

As the first application completed through the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Boot Camp, I'm very proud of this simple application. I leared HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript in a few weeks in order to build this page. After completing the boot camp, this app pales in comparison to what I can do now, but I enjoy this project in particular because it is a reminder of where I started and also how much can be accomplished with such little experience.
